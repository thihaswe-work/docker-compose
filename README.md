1. Basic Structure

Every docker-compose.yml file has 3 main sections:

version: "3" # optional in modern Compose (v2+ doesn’t require this)

services: # define your containers
service_name:
image: ... # or build: ...
ports: - "host_port:container_port"
volumes: - "./local:path/in/container"
environment: - KEY=value

services → each service = one container (like backend, frontend, db).

image → use a prebuilt Docker image (nginx, mysql).

build → build your own image from a Dockerfile in a folder.

ports → maps local machine port → container port.

volumes → share files between host & container.

environment → set environment variables inside container.

2. Your Example, Explained
   services:
   backend: # service name = "backend"
   build: ./backend # build an image from ./backend/Dockerfile
   ports: - "5000:5000" # map host:5000 -> container:5000

frontend: # service name = "frontend"
build: ./frontend # build from ./frontend/Dockerfile
ports: - "3000:3000" # map host:3000 -> container:3000
depends_on: # wait until backend starts before frontend - backend
command: ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host"] # override Dockerfile CMD so vite runs correctly

3. Step-by-Step Thinking

When writing a docker-compose.yml, ask yourself:

What containers do I need?
→ Example: backend, frontend, db.

Where do they come from?

Prebuilt? → image: node:20

Custom? → build: ./backend

How do they talk to each other?
→ Same file = same network.

Frontend can call backend at http://backend:5000.

What ports do I expose to my machine?

Backend → 5000:5000

Frontend → 3000:3000

Do I need special configs?

Override command if needed.

Add volumes if you want live reload.

4. Minimal Example You Can Write Yourself
   services:
   app:
   image: node:20
   working_dir: /app
   volumes: - .:/app
   command: ["node", "server.js"]
   ports: - "5000:5000"

👉 This runs a Node.js app from your local folder.

⚡ Tip: Once you learn the “building blocks” (services → build/image, ports, volumes, env, command), you can write any Compose file by just combining these.

Would you like me to make you a cheat sheet of the most common Compose keywords with small examples, so you can keep it next to you when writing?

You said:
can i depends_on two things?
ChatGPT said:

Yes ✅ you can absolutely make a service depends_on multiple other services.

In YAML, you just list them in an array:

services:
backend:
build: ./backend
ports: - "5000:5000"

database:
image: mysql:8
environment: - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret

frontend:
build: ./frontend
ports: - "3000:3000"
depends_on: - backend - database # ✅ depends on two services
command: ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host"]

👉 This means:

Docker will start backend and database before frontend.

But ⚠️ depends_on only controls start order, not “readiness.”

Example: database may take time to fully initialize (MySQL booting).

If frontend tries to connect too early, you might need extra logic like wait-for-it
or healthchecks.
